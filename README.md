# Modified DXVK's D3D9 adding eyecandy of bigger cursor

This repository is a fork of [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/) with following modification:

- Adding a new config option: `d3d9.enlargeHardwareCursor = 2 or 3 or 4`. When enabled, D3D9 hardware cursor would be enlarged into 2X, 3X or 4X size. So when play an elder D3D9 game on modern HiDPI display should be easier to see mouse cursor. Values other than 2, 3, 4 would be ignored.

- Allowing sideload images into D3D9 hardware cursor. While [hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx) algorithm is specially designed for pixel-art scaling, small cursor enlargement still result in low quality output. So this work also provide a way to sideload high resolution images into D3D9 hardware cursor.

- Enable `d3d9.enlargeHardwareCursor = 4` and `d3d9.deviceLossOnFocusLoss = True` for WoW.exe WoW_sideload-DLL.exe and WoW_tweaked.exe. 

The `d3d9.deviceLossOnFocusLoss = True` option is for running Vanilla WoW via [Proton-GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) and when enabling [AMD FSR](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html). When multiboxing, it seems Vanilla WoW need `d3d9.deviceLossOnFocusLoss` to switch between multiple full-screen FSR windows.

## How to use

For [Turtle WoW](https://turtle-wow.org/):

- Enable Hardware Cursor in game Video Options. While DXVK 2.5 does support software cursor, in my understanding hardware cursor should provide better performance, so I would currently keep enlargement code to hardware cursor only.

- Windows 11: Put d3d9.dll under the same folder with WoW.exe

- Debian Linux and WINE: Put d3d9.dll into WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32/

- Debian Linux and Proton: Put d3d9.dll into Proton_Directory/files/lib/wine/dxvk/

- WINE may need a DLL override via winecfg to mark d3d9 as Native. Proton don't need this.

For other games you might find more info from [upstream DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/)



## Sideload image into cursor

Sideload capability allows high definition images being loaded into D3D9 hardware cursor.

Some cursor set for Vanilla WoW here: https://github.com/allfoxwy/some-bigger-cursor

To sideload:
- Enable `d3d9.enlargeHardwareCursor = 2 or 3 or 4` option. The multiplier influence [hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx) scaling when no corresponding sideload image available.

- Create a new folder named `SideloadCursors` at the same location with d3d9.dll

- Put desired images into `SideloadCursors`. Their size must NOT bigger than 128x128 pixel. They could be JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC. They must contain 4 color channels.

- Rename images like `CursorHash-HotSpotX,HotSpotY.png`.

- Any number of images could be sideloaded. If the corresponding in-game cursor don't have sideload image, [hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx) algorithm scaling would be used.


Every in-game cursor would have a different CursorHash. If you are building your own cursor set, you would need this hash value information.

You could get this information via DXVK debug info. Run the game with an environment variable: `DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=info`

Whenever an in-game cursor appear or change, a CursorHash value would be printed to terminal/log-file like 
`info:  Enlarge D3D9 hardware cursor: d1e69d325ddb16a8`

HotSpot is the clickable spot coordinates on image. It doesn't have to be the center.

For example if you would like (12, 34) be hot spot for cursor `d1e69d325ddb16a8`,
You could rename your image as `d1e69d325ddb16a8-12,34.png`.



## Limitation

- Only works for **SOME** D3D9 games. No D3D11 nor D3D12.
- Only works for hardware cursor, not software cursor.
- Sideload only work for static image, no animation.
- I tested it on Debian Linux and Windows 11 using [Turtle WoW](https://turtle-wow.org/)
- According to MS document, if the underlaying platform can not support cursor size bigger than 32x32, API should scale the size back. However current implementation do not have such fallback capability. You may end up with no cursor.
- Vanilla WoW has a hard-coded 32x32 cursor. So current code has a 128x128 buffer for it. If you try using this code for another game, beware that if that game's cursor is already bigger than 32x32, the enlargement code would be bypassed.



## Algorithm

Image upscaling employs [hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx). Its implementation is from https://github.com/grom358/hqx

Hash calculation employs [MetroHash64](http://www.jandrewrogers.com/2015/05/27/metrohash/). Its implementation is from https://github.com/jandrewrogers/MetroHash
